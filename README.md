# Implementing some AI - ML algorithms from scratch  without any library
In this repository we're going to implement some of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from scratch without any other library like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch,... (We may use them to check if our own implementations are working.)
The only library we are going to use is NumPy and Pandas for dealing with our data. 

Some algorithms we're going to implement: <br />
    - Some uniformed search methods like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) <br />
    - Some informed search like A-Star Search (A*) and Greedy Best-First Search (GBF) <br />
    - Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithms in Game Theory<br />
    - Genetic Algorithm  for path finding and Traveling Salesman Person Problem (TSP problem) <br />
    - Linear Regression for predicting continuous values <br />
    - Logistic Regression for predicting binary values for classification <br />
    - Decision Tree for classifications problem and also for continuous values <br />
    - Forward propagation in Neural Network <br /> 
    - Backward propagation in Neural Network <br />

Hope you'll enjoy !<br />
